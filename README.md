==============

This repository contains Processing code created while making my thesis.

The interesting subdirectories are:

ColorBlending
-------------

Testing color blending in RGB, HSB and LAB color spaces.

MHTargets
---------

A reimplementation of the MakeHuman target system in Processing.

SkeletonPractice
----------------

The "cylinder man" implementation. This was later ported to Java and further improved---it's a better idea to look at that version.
